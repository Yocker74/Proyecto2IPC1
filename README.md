# Proyecto2IPC1

This game has 2 games, towers of hanoi and checkers, I also tried many methods to save data as users and games in order to load saved games but didnt work
it also has some statistics methods to show how your performance is through the games, but it just works for the default user "Nouser"
I couldnt load all the data of different users in a table, just the default one
You can add users to see your name while playing

Hanoi;
This game has the methods to play with a number of plates between 3 and 8, as well as a solver for the puzzle

Checkers:
It has only one mode, and is to play against another human, the "Nouser" always start as black.

I hope my next project wont be as shitty as this one, the code has a lot of methods i didnt finish or didnt work.
